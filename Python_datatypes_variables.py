# Python Data Types and Variables

"""
- The data types of an item defines the type and range
  of values that item can have.
- Python provides three main data type : nunbers , strings, booleans.

Variables :
- A variable is simply a name to which a value can be assigned (like a box)
- Variables are mutable . Hence, the value of a variable can always be updated
  and replaced 

Naming convention:
- the name can start with an upper or lower case alphabet.
- a number can appear in the name , but not at the beginning.
- underscore (_) can appear anywhere in the name.
- spaces are not allowed.
- the variable name should be something meaningful that describes
  the value it holds
